SpecFlow is open source, meaning you can help the community in improving SpecFlow by contributing fixes and new features. If you feel you can contribute to SpecFlow's development, a good place to start is to check out the [[issues that are up-for-grabs |https://github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Aup-for-grabs]] for feature requests. Remember that you need to be willing to invest your own blood, sweat and tears into writing code, as the list of pending features is long and development resources are limited.

If you want to contribute a larger change or new features, please first discuss your ideas with the community on the [[forum|http://groups.google.com/group/specflow]] to clear up any potential issues. This also ensures that you don't take on a task that someone else is working on. If you have an idea for improvements that are not in the To-Do list, please discuss your proposal first; you don't want to invest a lot of work into something that will not be merged with the release version.
