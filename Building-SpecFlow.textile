Currently we are building SpecFlow with VisualStudio 2010.

To build SpecFlow you need to install:
- "WiX Installer 3.5":http://wix.sourceforge.net/
- "Visual Studio 2010 SDK":http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=47305cf4-2bea-43c0-91cd-1b853602dcc5&displaylang=en
- "Silverlight 3 SDK":http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1ea49236-0de7-41b1-81c8-a126ff39975b&displaylang=en

Other notes:
- The Vs2008Integration package builds but it does not register automatically the integration component for the VS2008 experimental hive. For debugging the VS2008 integration component, you have to register this component manually.
