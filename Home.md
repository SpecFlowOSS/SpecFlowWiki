SpecFlow aims at **bridging the communication gap between domain experts and developers** by binding **business readable behavior specifications and examples** to the underlying implementation.

Our mission is to provide a pragmatic and frictionless approach to [[Specification-By-Example|http://www.specificationbyexample.com]] for .NET projects. 

SpecFlow also supports the concepts of Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD), which are often used synonymously with Specification-By-Example.

The official website of the SpecFlow project is: [[http://www.specflow.org]]

Source code, wiki and issue tracking is hosted here on GitHub.

Discussions are on Google Groups: [[http://groups.google.com/group/specflow/]]
