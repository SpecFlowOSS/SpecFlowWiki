## Build Integration

_Note: SpecFlow provides enhanced integration with Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2012 and Team Foundation Service. Please check the [[TFS 2012 Integration]] and the [[Team Foundation Service Integration]] pages for details._

As SpecFlow generates unit test code from the scenarios, the tests can be executed on any build server (as unit tests). The configuration depends on the unit test provider used.

For TFS 2010, the easiest way to use the [[MsTest provider|Unit Test Providers]]. Integrating report generation to the build process is pretty complex. Please [[contact the SpecFlow team|http://www.specflow.org/customization/]] if you need help.
