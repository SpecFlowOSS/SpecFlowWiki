For a brief description of the startup tasks and recently added new features, check out the SpecFlow website first: <br/>**[[http://www.specflow.org]]**

This page contains a detailed description of the possibilities.

SpecFlow consists of three parts:

* The **IDE Integration** that provides customized editor and test generation functions in your development environment, like Visual Studio 2012.
* The **generator** that can turn the Gherkin specifications into executable test classes.
* The **runtime** that is required for executing the generated tests. There are different runtime assemblies compiled for the different target platforms (.NET, Silverlight, Windows Phone). 

## Installation

The installation of the **IDE Intergation** packages depends on the IDE you use. For **Visual Studio 2012 and 2010**, the easiest way is to search for "SpecFlow" in the extension manager (_Extensions and Updates_ in VS2012) online search. For other IDE integrations and for the direct download links, check the [[Install IDE Integration]] page.

The **generator** and the **runtime** is usually installed together per project. The easiest and most convenient way to install these is to use our [[NuGet package|NuGet Integration]]: [[SpecFlow|http://www.nuget.org/packages/SpecFlow]] or one of the specific [[helper packages|NuGet Integration]]. For a detailed project setup guide, check the [[Setup SpecFlow Projects]] page.
