For a basic introduction to SpecFlow, information on new features, and help [[getting started|http://www.specflow.org/getting-started/]] visit the [[SpecFlow website|http://www.specflow.org]].

SpecFlow consists of three parts:

* The **IDE Integration** that provides a customized editor and test generation functions from within Visual Studio.
* The **generator** that turns Gherkin specifications into executable test classes.
* The **runtime** that executes the generated tests. There are different runtime assemblies compiled for different target platforms (.NET, Silverlight, Windows Phone). 

## Installation

installing the **IDE Integration** packages depends on your IDE. If you are using **Visual Studio 2012 or 2010**, the easiest way is to search for "SpecFlow" in the online search in the extension manager (_Extensions and Updates_ in VS2012). For information on other IDEs and direct download links, see the [[Install IDE Integration]] page.

The **generator** and the **runtime** are usually installed together per project. The easiest and most convenient way to install these is to use our [[NuGet package|NuGet Integration]]: [[SpecFlow|http://www.nuget.org/packages/SpecFlow]] or one of the specific [[helper packages|NuGet Integration]]. For a detailed project setup guide, see [[Setup SpecFlow Projects]].
