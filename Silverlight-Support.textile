Install "Silverlight Toolkit":http://silverlight.codeplex.com/
It comes with the  SL Unit Test Framework (http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/silverlightut)

In your solution add a "Silverlight Unit Test Application" project. This adds a Silverlight Application project with the tests and a web project to the solution. The latter hosts the test application to execute it in the browser.

Add an app.config to the project (even if it's not supported by SL), with the following content:

@<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
 <configSections>@
   <section name="specFlow"
type="TechTalk.SpecFlow.Configuration.ConfigurationSectionHandler,
TechTalk.SpecFlow"/>
 </configSections>

 <specFlow>
   <unitTestProvider name="MsTest.Silverlight" />
 </specFlow>
</configuration>


This'll get the generator to create MsTest + silverlight-compatible c# files for every feature file you add.
