* Install "Silverlight Toolkit":http://silverlight.codeplex.com/
It comes with the  SL Unit Test Framework (http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/silverlightut)

* In your solution add a "Silverlight Unit Test Application" project. This adds a Silverlight Application project with the tests and a web project to the solution. The latter hosts the test application to execute it in the browser.

* Add an app.config to the project (even if it's not supported by SL), with the following content:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/457878.js?file=gistfile1.xml"></script>

This'll get the generator to create MsTest + silverlight-compatible c# files for every feature file you add.
