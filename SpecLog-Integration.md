[[SpecLog|http://www.speclog.net/]] is a collaborative tool by TechTalk for agile requirement engineering with strong integration to SpecFlow and ALM tools (initially TFS 2010).

SpecLog can visualize the Gherkin acceptance criteria to enhance business readability. It can synchronize the feature files from the source-control repository of the project and present them in context of the other specification artifacts, like user stories or business goals. 

SpecLog is optimized for occasionally connected scenarios, therefore is allows your business to access the feature files also offline.
