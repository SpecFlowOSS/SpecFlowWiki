[[SpecLog|http://www.speclog.net/]] is a collaborative tool by TechTalk for agile requirement engineering with strong integration to SpecFlow and ALM tools (currently for TFS 2010, TFS 2012 and JIRA).

Feature files are linked from source-control repositories to context of the other specification artifacts, like user stories or business goals. 

SpecLog allows visualizing and structuring Gherkin feature files in maps (e.g. Story Maps, Impact Maps, functional tree) and to extend feature files with further documentation artifacts like pictures, links and additional documents. This helps providing a more comprehensive living documentation and enhances readability of Gherkin scenarios.

This [[documentation can be also exported to HTML|http://www.speclog.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BookShop.html#US1]], which makes it easier to share with stakeholders, and allows linking Gherkin scenarios with other documentation systems (e.g. operations manual, user reference, etc.). SpecLog also allows working offline to support users that are only occasionally connected to a network.
