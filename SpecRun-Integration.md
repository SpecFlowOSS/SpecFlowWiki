[[SpecRun|http://www.specrun.com]] is a smarter integration test runner for SpecFlow: 

* Faster feedback: parallel test execution and smart execution order
* More information: advanced metrics, detecting random failures, historical execution statistics
* Not limited to SpecFlow: execute integration tests written with other unit testing frameworks

The SpecRun integration can be setup by adding a NuGet package to your project: `[[SpecRun.SpecFlow|http://www.nuget.org/packages/SpecRun.SpecFlow]]`. After the project is configured to use SpecRun, the "Run/Debug SpecFlow Scenarios" context menu commands will execute the tests (by default) with SpecRun.
