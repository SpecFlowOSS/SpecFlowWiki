The SpecFlow documentation is available for reading at [[http://www.specflow.org/documentation/]].

The documentation pages on the SpecFlow website are mirrored from the GitHub wiki (with an hourly refresh). If you spot a mistake in the documentation or you would like to improve the content, please edit the pages here on GitHub. When browsing the pages on the SpecFlow website, direct edit links are available at the bottom of each page for your convenience. Please use Markdown formatting for the documentation pages. If you want to add a new page to the documentation, you also need to add it to the [[table of contents|Documentation TOC]]. If you do so (or if you have any other questions), please [[send a note to us|http://www.specflow.org/Contact/]].
