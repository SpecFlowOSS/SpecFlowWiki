_As the SpecFlow project team_
_we would like to have more information about the users and usage scenarios of SpecFlow in the real world_
_so that we can prioritize future actions._

There is a **new survey** since the release of SpecFlow 1.6. 
We would appreciate your feedback, even when you already participated in previous surveys. Thanks!
