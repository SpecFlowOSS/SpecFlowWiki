## Installation for Visual Studio 2008/2010 Express (Free)
* SpecFlow is designed to integrate into Visual Studio, and since Visual Studio Express [doesn't allow Add-Ins or Macros](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/86562/what-is-missing-in-the-visual-studio-2008-express-editions), you can't use it as designed.
* There are workarounds available, that essentially involve manually copying the template files to your system, and using the specflow.exe command line tool to generate and run SpecFlow tests.
* See this blog post for more detail: [http://watirmelon.com/2011/02/18/c-sharp-atdd-on-a-shoestring/](http://watirmelon.com/2011/02/18/c-sharp-atdd-on-a-shoestring/)
