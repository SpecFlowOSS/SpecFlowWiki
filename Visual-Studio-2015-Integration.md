SpecFlow provides integration for Visual Studio 2015 (Community, Professional, Enterprise editions).

The Visual Studio 2015 support can be installed from [[Visual Studio Gallery|http://go.specflow.org/vsgallery2015]] or from the online search in Visual Studio / Tools / Extensions and Updates. (You have to search for "SpecFlow" :).

The Visual Studio 2015 support is provided as a different Visual Studio Gallery package than the one for VS2013. This means that this integration tracks the reviews and ratings separately from the previous one.

**Please help us and the other users by rating the package on the [[Visual Studio Gallery|http://go.specflow.org/vsgallery2015]] page!**

## Supported Features

Currently the Visual Studio 2015 integration provides the same feature set as [[Visual Studio 2013 Integration]]. See details there.
