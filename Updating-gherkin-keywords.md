The keywords that SpecFlow uses are defined by the Gherkin project [[https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin]]. Gherkin defines an established language that is used in a lot of tools. It is currently not the goal nor in the scope of the SpecFlow project
to define or change that language.

Please submit a change request for the Gherkin project and as soon as it is fixed in Gherkin, SpecFlow can upgrade to use that one.
