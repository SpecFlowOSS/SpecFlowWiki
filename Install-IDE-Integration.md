_Editor note: We recommend reading this documentation entry at [[http://www.specflow.org/documentation/Visual-Studio-2013-Integration]]. We use the GitHub wiki for authoring the documentation pages._

For using SpecFlow in the most continent way, we recommend installing the IDE Integration component to your environment.

_Note:_ Although the IDE integrations can make the SpecFlow usage much easier, it is also possible to use SpecFlow **without IDE integration**. See the [[MsBuild Integration|Generate Tests from MsBuild]] page for details. 

## Install IDE Integration for Visual Studio 2010, 2012 and 2013

_Note:_ Visual Studio 2013 integration will be available soon. Please stay tuned!

For Visual Studio 2012 and 2010, the easiest way is to simply search for “SpecFlow” in the extension manager (_Extensions and Updates_ in VS2012) online gallery.

The integration package can also be downloaded and installed separately from the [[Visual Studio Gallery|http://go.specflow.org/vsgallery]] site.

[[SpecRun|http://www.specrun.com]] provides seamless integration to Visual Studio Test Window and Team Foundation Server (TFS) Build. Please check the short introduction videos on the [[SpecRun website|http://www.specrun.com]].
