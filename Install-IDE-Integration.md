SpecFlow IDE integration installation has been changed in SpecFlow v1.9!

Install IDE integration packages depending on the IDE:

* **Visual Studio 2012 and 2010**: [[Visual Studio Gallery|http://go.specflow.org/vsgallery]] (You can also install it directly from Visual Studio from the extension manager online search.)
* MonoDevelop: [[MonoDevelop Add-in Repository|http://go.specflow.org/monodevelop-addin]]
* SharpDevelop: [[download addin and install it from SharpDevelop AddIn Manager|http://go.specflow.org/download-sdaddin]]
* Visual Studio 2008: [[download installer|http://go.specflow.org/download-vs2008msi]]
* Visual Studio 2008/2010/2012 _Express Edition_: See [[Visual Studio Express Integration]] page

Read more about the changes in the [[What's New Guide|http://go.specflow.org/whatsnew-19]].

_Note:_ Although the IDE integrations can make the SpecFlow usage much easier, it is also possible to use SpecFlow **without IDE integration**. See the [[MsBuild Integration|Generate Tests from MsBuild]] page for details.
