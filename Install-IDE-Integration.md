_Editor note: We recommend reading this documentation entry at [[http://www.specflow.org/documentation/Install-IDE-Integration]]. We use the GitHub wiki for authoring the documentation pages._

We recommend installing the IDE Integration component for your development environment, as this is the most convenient way of working with SpecFlow.

_Note:_ Although installing the IDE integration makes it much easier to use SpecFlow, you can also use SpecFlow **without the IDE integration**. For more details refer to the [[MsBuild Integration|Generate Tests from MsBuild]] page. 

## Installing the IDE Integration for Visual Studio 2010 - 2017

_Note:_ **Visual Studio 2017** integration is available!.

The easiest way to install the IDE integration is to select **Tools | Extensions and Updates** from the menu (or **Tools | Extension Manager** in VS2010) and search for "SpecFlow" in the online gallery. 

The integration packages can also be downloaded and installed separately from the Visual Studio Gallery:  

* [[VS2010 and VS2012 integration|http://go.specflow.org/vsgallery]]
* [[VS2013 integration|http://go.specflow.org/vsgallery2013]]
* [[VS2015 integration|http://go.specflow.org/vsgallery2015]].
* [[VS2017 integration|http://go.specflow.org/vsgallery2017]].

[[SpecFlow+ Runner|http://www.specflow.org/plus/runner]] provides seamless integration with Visual Studio's Test Explorer and Team Foundation Server (TFS) Build. A short [[introduction video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBs2Lwqt5kI]] is available on YouTube and you can find links to additional videos on the [[SpecFlow website|http://www.specflow.org/plus/runner]].
